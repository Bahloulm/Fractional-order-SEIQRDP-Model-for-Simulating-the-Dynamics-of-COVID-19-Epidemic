# Goal: 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  is  a  contagious   disease   caused   by   a   newly   discovered   coronavirus, initially   identified   in   the   mainland   of  China,   late   December2019.   COVID-19   has   been   confirmed   as   a   higher   infectious disease   that   can   spread   quickly   in   a   community population depending on  the  number  of  susceptible  and  infected  cases  and also   depending   on   their   movement   in   the   community.   Since January  2020,  COVID-19  has  reached  out  to  many  countries worldwide,  and  the  number  of  daily  cases  remains  to  increase rapidly. 

# Method:
Several mathematical and statistical models have been developed to understand,  track,  and  forecast  the  trend of   the   virus   spread.Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP)model  is  one  of  the most  promising  epidemiological  models  that  has  been  suggested for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study, we propose a fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic. In the recent decade, it has proven that many aspects in many domains can be described very successfully using fractional-order differential equations.  Accordingly, the Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate,  and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, due to its non-locality properties, a fractional-order operator takes into consideration the variables’ memory effect, and hence,  it takes  into  account  the  sub-diffusion  process  of  confirmed  and recovered cases.

# Results:
The validation of the studied fractional-order model using real COVID-19  data  for  different  regions  in China,  Italy,  and  France  show  the  potential  of  the  proposed paradigm in predicting and understanding the pandemic dynamic.

# Conclusions:
Fractional-order epidemiological models might play an important role in understanding and predicting the spread of the COVID-19, also providing relevant guidelines for controlling the pandemic.
